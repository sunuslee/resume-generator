this is a command line based resume generator.
it'll give you a nicely indent resume.
some commands:(all commands are end with EOF<CTRL+D>)
name r      -> change your name
name a      -> add your name(when creating a new resume)
phone r     -> change your phone number
phone a     -> add a phone number
mail a/r
intern a/r
about a/r
project a/r
skill a/r
minor a/r
the commands are basicaly the same, using a for add a field and r for replace a field.
there are two special commands:
load
done
those two has NO parameter. when you finish editing your resume, just use done command, the resume will be 'r.html' in the folder where you put this programm.
There must be a lot a bug to be fixed, i will fixed them as soon as i find
them.
PS:
resume-cn.html
resume-en.html
are the samples.
